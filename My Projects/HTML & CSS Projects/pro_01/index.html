            <p>Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, India, was a prominent Hindu
                monk and a key figure in introducing Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world. He
                played a crucial role in the revival of Hinduism in India and contributed significantly to the spread of
                Indian spirituality and philosophy globally.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Vivekananda's journey began with his association with the Indian mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Under
                Ramakrishna's guidance, he explored various spiritual practices and developed a deep understanding of
                Vedanta, which emphasizes the oneness of the individual soul (Atman) with the universal soul (Brahman).
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>In 1893, Swami Vivekananda represented India at the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago. His
                opening words, "Sisters and brothers of America," resonated with the audience and marked the beginning
                of his impactful speeches on tolerance, universal acceptance, and the importance of religious harmony.
                This historic address established him as a charismatic and influential speaker.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Vivekananda spent several years traveling across the United States and Europe, addressing various
                audiences and promoting the principles of Vedanta and Yoga. He aimed to foster a greater understanding
                between East and West and to inspire individuals to realize their innate divinity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 1897, Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission to propagate the teachings of his
                guru, Ramakrishna. The mission's objectives included the promotion of education, social service, and
                spiritual upliftment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Swami Vivekananda's teachings encompassed the ideas of selfless service (seva), harmony of religions, and
                the divinity of the human soul. He emphasized the importance of character-building education and the
                integration of spiritual values into daily life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Tragically, Swami Vivekananda's life was cut short when he passed away on July 4, 1902, at the age of 39.
                Despite his relatively short life, his legacy endures, and he is remembered as a spiritual giant whose
                teachings continue to inspire millions around the world.</p>
